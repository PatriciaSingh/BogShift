# BogShift
## Climate-driven future ecosystem loss and range shift in ombrotrophic bogs and implications for conservation, restoration, and carbon storage

Climate change and human-induced landscape alterations are causing significant ecosystem
shifts, challenging biodiversity conservation. Ombrotrophic peatlands, crucial for carbon
storage, face degradation threats. Restoring them is vital for carbon neutrality and biodiversity.
Limited resources hinder conservation, requiring optimal area identification. This project
employs ecological niche modelling (ENM) to predict future bog distribution shifts under climate
change scenarios in holarctic regions. Enhancing ENM assumptions aims to improve accuracy.
Outcomes, presented through a web application, will guide bog conservation efforts. The project
comprises four work packages: evaluating the historical climate's impact on bog distribution,
assessing bog niches, studying climate change effects on bog habitat types, and developing a
web application for model implementation and decision-making. The project provides valuable
tools for practitioners in nature conservation and restoration.

Refining future projections of ombrotrophic peatlands' habitat loss and range shifts by
challenging conventional ecological niche modelling assumptions. The resulting optimal areas
implemented in the web application will guide peatland protection and restoration efforts.
